# CoreML Models Directory

This directory is reserved for CoreML models.

Currently using image brightness-based prediction in MLService.swift.

To add a CoreML model in the future:
1. Train your model using CreateML or other tools
2. Add the .mlmodel file here
3. Update MLService.swift to use the model

For now, the app works perfectly with brightness-based prediction!
