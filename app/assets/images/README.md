# Assets Directory

This directory contains images for the AirLens project.

## Required Images

The following images are referenced in the HTML files but need to be created:

### Favicon
- `favicon.png` - 32x32 or 64x64 icon for browser tabs

### Social Media Images (Open Graph)
- `og-image.png` - 1200x630 default Open Graph image for homepage
- `camera-og.png` - 1200x630 Open Graph image for Camera AI page
- `globe-og.png` - 1200x630 Open Graph image for Globe page
- `twitter-card.png` - 1200x600 Twitter Card image
- `screenshot.png` - Application screenshot for structured data

## Temporary Solution

If these images are not available, you can:
1. Remove the Open Graph image meta tags from the HTML files
2. Use a default placeholder image
3. Generate simple images using image generation tools

The site will work without these images, but social media sharing and branding will be limited.
