## Why AirLens?

Air pollution is the world's largest environmental health risk, responsible for an estimated **6.7 million premature deaths annually** (WHO, 2024). Governments across the globe have implemented various policies to combat this crisis — from vehicle emission standards to industrial regulations, clean energy transitions to urban green zones.

**But how do we know if these policies actually work?**

Measuring the real impact of environmental policies is surprisingly difficult:
- **Natural variation** — air quality fluctuates due to weather, seasons, and geography
- **Multiple factors** — economic changes, population shifts, and neighboring countries' emissions all play a role
- **Data gaps** — over 90% of the world's population lives in areas without ground-based air quality monitors
- **Delayed effects** — policy impacts may take years to become statistically measurable

**AirLens addresses these challenges** by combining real-time sensor data, satellite observations, and statistical analysis to provide transparent, data-driven answers about whether environmental policies are making a real difference.

## What AirLens Does

### 🌐 3D Globe — See air quality everywhere, at a glance
Interactive Three.js globe displaying real-time PM2.5 levels from monitoring stations worldwide. Satellite AOD data fills in the gaps where ground sensors don't exist. Click any location for detailed readings and trends.

### 📊 Policy Impact Analysis — 66 countries, data-driven insights
Compare air quality before and after policy implementation across 66 countries. Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology helps separate policy effects from natural variation. Each country profile includes policy timeline, PM2.5 trends, and change metrics.

### 📈 Today Dashboard — Your city, right now
Real-time city-level air quality cards with EPA-standard color coding, hourly sparklines, and WHO guideline comparisons. Know instantly whether the air you're breathing is safe.

### 📷 Camera AI — Estimate air quality from a photo *(Experimental)*
Upload a sky photo and receive an estimated air quality category. Deep learning analyzes haze patterns, visibility, and color — all processed in your browser. Your photo never leaves your device.

### 🛰️ Satellite Estimation — Where sensors can't reach
Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data, combined with weather conditions, provides PM2.5 estimates for regions with no ground monitoring. All estimates include uncertainty ranges.

## Analysis Models — Why We Use Them

| # | Model | Why | Status |
|---|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Policy Impact Analysis** | Statistically separates policy effects from natural PM2.5 variation using DID methodology | ✅ 66 countries |
| 2 | **Satellite → PM2.5** | Fills the global monitoring gap — 90%+ of the world lacks ground sensors | 🔬 Developing |
| 3 | **Camera AI** | Enables anyone with a smartphone to estimate air quality from a sky photo | ⚗️ Experimental |
| 4 | **Data Quality Score** | Not all sensor data is equally reliable — DQSS rates each source 0–100 | ✅ Active |
| 5 | **Bayesian Reliability** | Sensors degrade over time — tracks trustworthiness as data accumulates | 📋 Planned |
| 6 | **Anomaly Detection** | Auto-identifies sensor malfunctions and data errors before they skew results | 📋 Planned |

> ML training code and model artifacts are maintained in a private development workspace.

## Core Values

- **Transparency** — All data sources, uncertainties, and quality scores are explicitly shown
- **Scientific Integrity** — Predictions are presented as supplementary estimates, never as ground truth
- **Reproducibility** — Fixed seeds, version control, preprocessing logs
- **Honest Uncertainty** — Experimental features are clearly labeled; no fabricated metrics
- **Privacy** — Camera photos are processed in-browser only; no data is sent to any server
